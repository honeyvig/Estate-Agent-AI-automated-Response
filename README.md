# Estate-Agent-AI-automated-Response
To create an application for UK-based estate agents that manages incoming enquiries from platforms like Zoopla, Rightmove, OntheMarket, or the client's own website, and automatically responds to those inquiries via WhatsApp or SMS using a custom knowledge base, I would suggest building a system using Twilio API for WhatsApp and SMS integration, OpenAI API for generating responses based on the estate agents’ knowledge base, and a backend to integrate everything smoothly.
High-Level Overview of the System:

    Incoming Enquiries: The system will receive property-related enquiries via webhooks from platforms like Zoopla, Rightmove, or a custom website.
    Processing Enquiries: The system will generate appropriate responses using a pre-defined knowledge base, possibly stored in a database, and OpenAI's GPT API.
    Platform Integration: Messages will be sent and received via WhatsApp using the Twilio API. If WhatsApp fails, the system will fall back on SMS using Twilio.
    User Journeys: The system will support pre-set user journeys, allowing for structured conversation paths like enquiry about property availability, scheduling viewings, etc.
    Weekly Refinement Sessions: The system should be flexible for updates based on user feedback, with regular development refinement sessions.

Key Technologies:

    Twilio API: To send and receive WhatsApp messages and SMS.
    OpenAI API (GPT-3 or GPT-4): For generating responses based on the knowledge base.
    Flask/Django (Python): For the backend to handle requests and integrate with APIs.
    Database: For storing knowledge base data related to the UK property market and user journeys (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
    Webhooks: To receive incoming enquiries from Zoopla, Rightmove, or websites.

Python Code to Integrate Twilio, OpenAI, and a Knowledge Base

This code will demonstrate how to integrate incoming enquiries, process them with OpenAI, and send responses via WhatsApp (or SMS if WhatsApp fails).
Requirements:

    Twilio account for WhatsApp and SMS integration.
    OpenAI API key for generating responses.
    Flask to create a webhook server for incoming enquiries.

Install required dependencies:

pip install twilio flask openai

Python Code Implementation:

import os
from twilio.rest import Client
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai
from datetime import datetime

# Setup API keys and configurations
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'  # Your OpenAI API key
twilio_account_sid = 'your-twilio-account-sid'
twilio_auth_token = 'your-twilio-auth-token'
twilio_phone_number = 'your-twilio-phone-number'
client_phone_number = 'client-phone-number'

# Initialize Twilio Client
twilio_client = Client(twilio_account_sid, twilio_auth_token)

# Flask setup for receiving webhook
app = Flask(__name__)

# Placeholder for knowledge base (can be expanded or moved to a DB)
knowledge_base = {
    "property_availability": "We currently have several properties available for viewing. Can you please specify the area you're interested in?",
    "schedule_viewing": "To schedule a viewing, please provide your preferred date and time. Our agents will confirm availability shortly.",
    "general_inquiry": "How can I assist you today? Are you looking for a new home or have specific questions about a property?",
}

def generate_response(user_input):
    """Generate AI response based on user input using OpenAI."""
    prompt = f"The user is asking about property inquiries. The knowledge base includes: {knowledge_base}\n\nUser query: {user_input}\n\nResponse:"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can use GPT-4 for better accuracy
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

def send_whatsapp_message(to, body):
    """Send a WhatsApp message using Twilio."""
    message = twilio_client.messages.create(
        body=body,
        from_=f'whatsapp:{twilio_phone_number}',  # Twilio WhatsApp sandbox number or your own number
        to=f'whatsapp:{to}'
    )
    return message

def send_sms_message(to, body):
    """Send an SMS message using Twilio."""
    message = twilio_client.messages.create(
        body=body,
        from_=twilio_phone_number,  # Twilio phone number for SMS
        to=to
    )
    return message

@app.route('/incoming-enquiry', methods=['POST'])
def incoming_enquiry():
    """Handle incoming enquiries via webhook."""
    data = request.json

    # Example: data contains 'platform', 'user_query', 'user_phone_number'
    platform = data.get('platform')
    user_query = data.get('user_query')
    user_phone_number = data.get('user_phone_number')

    # Step 1: Generate response based on user query
    ai_response = generate_response(user_query)

    # Step 2: Try to send a WhatsApp message first, fallback to SMS if WhatsApp fails
    try:
        if platform == 'whatsapp':
            send_whatsapp_message(user_phone_number, ai_response)
        else:
            send_sms_message(user_phone_number, ai_response)
        return jsonify({"status": "success", "message": "Response sent successfully"}), 200
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to SMS in case of failure with WhatsApp
        print(f"Error sending WhatsApp message: {e}")
        send_sms_message(user_phone_number, ai_response)
        return jsonify({"status": "error", "message": "WhatsApp failed, SMS sent instead"}), 500

@app.route('/health', methods=['GET'])
def health_check():
    """Health check for the app."""
    return jsonify({"status": "running"}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Key Components of the Code:

    Flask Webhook (/incoming-enquiry):
        This route listens for incoming POST requests with the property enquiry details (platform, user_query, user_phone_number).
        It processes the incoming query and generates an appropriate response using OpenAI's GPT.

    OpenAI Integration:
        The generate_response function uses GPT to generate a response based on the user's query and the predefined knowledge base.
        You can customize the knowledge base and make it more dynamic by storing it in a database or enhancing the AI model for a more tailored response.

    Twilio Integration:
        The send_whatsapp_message and send_sms_message functions use Twilio’s APIs to send messages over WhatsApp and SMS, respectively.
        The fallback mechanism tries to send the message via WhatsApp, and if it fails, it sends an SMS.

    Health Check:
        The /health endpoint ensures that the application is running correctly, which is helpful for monitoring.

Deployment and Integration:

    Incoming Webhooks: The estate agent platforms (Zoopla, Rightmove, OntheMarket) will send incoming enquiries through a webhook. These can be mapped to a POST request in this Flask app.
    Hosting: You can deploy this Flask app using platforms like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or Google Cloud Run for scalability.
    Scalability: If you need to scale, consider using Celery with Redis for handling background tasks (like sending messages) and scaling it across multiple workers.

Estimated Timeline & Feedback:

    Initial Setup and Integration: 2-3 weeks to integrate Twilio, OpenAI, and the knowledge base.
    Customizing User Journeys: 1-2 weeks for refining based on client feedback, adding different types of responses (e.g., available properties, booking viewings).
    Testing & Deployment: 1-2 weeks for ensuring the platform works smoothly with real user data and debugging any issues.
    Maintenance and Iteration: Ongoing post-deployment support (1-2 weeks/month for weekly refinement sessions).

Potential Next Steps:

    Review the current requirements and adjust the scope if necessary.
    Set up the database for knowledge base storage and ensure compliance with GDPR (important for handling user data in the UK).
    Test different platforms (Zoopla, Rightmove) for API/webhook integration.
